# Check if the script is run as root
if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Please run as root"
  exit 1

# Check if both arguments are provided
if [ "$#" -ne 2 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <chromeos_image.xz> <device_identifier>"
  exit 1
fi

# Confirm the operation with the user
read -p "This will write ChromeOS recovery to /dev/$2. Are you sure? (Y/n): " confirm
if [[ ! "$confirm" =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
  echo "Operation cancelled"
  exit 0

# Write ChromeOS recovery to the USB drive
