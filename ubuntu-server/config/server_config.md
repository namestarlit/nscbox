Configuring a new server involves several steps to ensure both security and smooth operation. Below is a checklist you can follow:

1. **Update Operating System:**
   - Update the operating system to the latest patches and security updates.

2. **Secure SSH Access:**
   - Disable root login.
   - Use SSH keys for authentication instead of passwords.
   - Change the default SSH port.
   - Use a firewall (like UFW) to limit SSH access to specific IP addresses.

3. **Install and Configure Firewall:**
   - Set up a firewall (like UFW or iptables) to restrict incoming and outgoing traffic.
   - Allow only necessary ports for services you intend to run.

4. **User Management:**
   - Create a dedicated user for system administration tasks.
   - Use `sudo` for privilege escalation.
   - Disable unnecessary user accounts.

5. **Enable Automatic Updates:**
   - Set up automatic security updates to ensure your system is always up-to-date.

6. **Secure Services:**
   - Secure web server configurations (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
   - Configure database access controls (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   - Harden FTP and other services if necessary.

7. **Monitor System Logs:**
   - Configure log rotation and monitoring (e.g., using `logrotate`).
   - Monitor system logs for unusual activities or errors.

8. **Backup and Disaster Recovery:**
   - Set up regular backups of important data.
   - Test backup restoration procedures to ensure they work as expected.

9. **Install Security Tools:**
   - Install and configure intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) if needed.
   - Use security scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities.

10. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
    - Enable 2FA for administrative access to the server if possible.

11. **Implement Security Best Practices:**
    - Disable unnecessary services and remove unused software.
    - Apply the principle of least privilege (grant only necessary permissions).
    - Regularly review and update security configurations.

12. **Physical Security:**
    - Secure physical access to the server room/data center.

13. **Regular Maintenance:**
    - Regularly review and update security configurations.
    - Perform periodic security audits and vulnerability assessments.

14. **Documentation:**
    - Document server configurations, procedures, and security measures for reference.

By following this checklist, you can help ensure that your server is configured securely and operates smoothly. Remember that security is an ongoing process, so regularly review and update your configurations to address new threats and vulnerabilities.
